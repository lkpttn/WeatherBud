# WeatherBud
Friendly. Beautiful. Weather.

Say hello to WeatherBud, the easiest way to glance at the weather.

## Now Open Source!
I've had fun with my foray into app development and now am opening up the source code for the app, including the
Forecastr wrapper for the Forecast.io API by Rob Phillips.

## Getting Started
You'll need to uncompress the WeatherBud.rar file and keep it in the same directory. It contains all the images and other resources for the app.
